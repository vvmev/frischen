Welcome to Frischen's documentation!
====================================

The Frischen project contains components for building railway signal tower
simulations.  Components are implemented in Python and JavaScript, and use the
MQTT protocol to interact with each other.

The Frischen project is open source software under the BSD license. You can
find the code as well as the documentation at
`github.com/vvmev/frischen <https://github.com/vvmev/frischen>`_.
